# tarot
Tarot reading console application, developed in NET 5.0.

## Goal
The goal of the program is to make a background process/daemon or "API"-like program which interfaces/clients can call, similar to [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org/), or other Linux programs. It would most likely be easier/wiser to just create a normal program without any daemon-like properties, but this is a learning experience to create such programs and how to interface with them. I would also like to make this suitable for Linux, and create a CLI for it, similar to how [ncmpcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp) interacts with mpd.

## Inspiration
I've had a great interest in tarot cards for a while. I don't personally believe in it, but it is a fun hobby and has a lot of interesting concepts. My recent intrigue for it grew after viewing these projects, in particular:  
[The Alleyman's Tarot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/713books/the-alleymans-tarot/description), by 713Books.
